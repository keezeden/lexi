# Lexi

A lightweight dictionary and personal lexicon for expanding your vocabulary while reading.

## Why?

I found myself constantly being distracted by researching the meanings of words while reading academic papers/novels. This tool is meant to solve this issue by providing a tool to quickly research and record words for instant understanding and future study.


## Get Started

To get started, run:

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

You'll need a [Merriam Webster](https://www.dictionaryapi.com/) API key. Add this into the your env file.

## Where to?

- Hands free operation (voice search)
- Better dictionary API (premium, custom...)
